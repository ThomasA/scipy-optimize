## Glossary

Model
:   A function that describes the relationship between dependent and
    independent variables in the data.

Model parameters
:   Variables of the model that are neiter dependent variables or independent
    variables in the data, but adjust the relationship between them, as
    described by the model. These sometimes correspond to underlying constructs
    of interest in the data. In some cases, additional calculations on the
    parameters can be used to make inferences about these constructs.
