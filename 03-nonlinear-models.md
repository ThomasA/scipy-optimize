We will use the `scipy` library to fit this non-linear model.

## `Scipy`

This library contains many functions that are useful in a variety of scientific
computing tasks.

If you import the library, you will see that it is composed of a variety of
sub-modules, each devoted to a different set of algorithms, or a topic:


~~~ {.python}
import scipy
scipy?

~~~ {.output}

SciPy: A scientific computing package for Python
================================================

Documentation is available in the docstrings and
online at http://docs.scipy.org.

Contents
--------
SciPy imports all the functions from the NumPy namespace, and in
addition provides:

Subpackages
-----------
Using any of these subpackages requires an explicit import.  For example,
``import scipy.cluster``.

To use any one of these sub-modules, we'll need to import it specifically.
