# Summary 

This 3-hour course aims to teach participants to use the Scipy library's `optimize` module to fit models to data [@scipy]. 

The objectives of the course are: 

Part 1: 

- Learners can define what a model is.
- Learners can define model parameters and model fitting.
- Learners can restate the benefits of modeling
- Learners can explain the utility of modeling applied to their data.

Part 2: 
- Learners can identify a linear model.
- Learners can use numpy to fit a linear model to data
- Learners can evaluate a model using model residual

Part 3: 
- Learners can identify a nonlinear model, and discuss the differences between linear and nonlinear models
- Learners can use scipy.optimize to fit a nonlinear model to data.
- Learners can calculate and display model residuals for nonlinear models

Part 4:
- Learners can define and identify overfitting.
- Learners can implement split-half cross-validation to evaluate model error.

The module uses data from a psychology experiment [@rokem091553] as an example.
