Fitting models and testing the match of the models to the measured data is a
fundamental activity in many fields of science. In this lesson, we will learn
how to use non-linear optimization routines in `scipy.optimize`, to fit models
to data.

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> Learners need to know how to use Python and Numpy, to the level taught
> in the Software Carpentry novice lesson.
>


> ## Getting ready {.getready}
>
> You need to download some files to follow this lesson:
>  1. Download
> 1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `python-novice-inflammation`.
> 2. Download [scipy-optimize-data.zip](./scipy-optimize-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.
> 3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called `scipy-optimize-data`.
